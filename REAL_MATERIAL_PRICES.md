## ðŸŽ¯ Key Points

1. **These are the REAL prices** from your actual database
2. **Much lower prices** than what I incorrectly listed before
3. **These prices will be used** in the budget calculation
4. **The form will calculate** using these exact amounts

## ðŸ’° Example Budget with REAL Prices

**User Input:**
- 10 Laptop - Office
- 5 Desktop - Office  
- 2 Printers
- 1 Traceau

**Budget Calculation:**
- 10 Ã— Laptop - Office: 10 Ã— â‚¬12.00 = â‚¬120.00
- 5 Ã— Desktop - Office: 5 Ã— â‚¬3.00 = â‚¬15.00
- 2 Ã— Printer: 2 Ã— â‚¬1.00 = â‚¬2.00
- 1 Ã— Traceau: 1 Ã— â‚¬1.00 = â‚¬1.00

**Total: â‚¬138.00** (1,463.20 MAD)

## âœ… Fixed

I've updated the setup file with the **REAL prices** from your database. Now when users create projects, the budget will calculate using these actual prices, not the wrong ones I listed before.

Sorry for the confusion - these are the correct prices that match what's shown in your materials dashboard! ðŸŽ¯
